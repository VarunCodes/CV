## Skills

#### Communication
  I am a clear communicator and take XP values to heart when interacting with team members and my pair programmers.

#### Competitive
  I believe that looking to improve and pick up new skills is integral to being a developer, and I'm open to working with people with different skillsets as it provides us new opportunities to learn.

#### Proactive/independent learner
  Throughout my course at Makers I've eagerly taken on new concepts and incorporate them to my skill-set.
