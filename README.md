## Skills

#### Communication
As a clear communicator I have taken XP values to heart when interacting with my group members and pair programmers, and I respond positively to feedback from peers. I am confident when suggesting new approaches while at the same time being empathetic to the dynamics of the group.

#### Competitive
I believe that striving to improve and being hungry to pick up new skills is integral to move forward as a developer, and throughout my time at Makers I've quickly grasped new concepts and incorporated them into my skill set. I like inheriting responsibility and pushing to see how far I can go in a given amount of time.

#### Team player

I'm eager to work with people with different skillsets as it provides us valuable opportunities to learn, as well as being empathetic to accommodate for my pair partner's or team member's learning.

## Education
